# TAD: A Large-scale Benchmark for Traffic Accidents Detection from Video Surveillance

## Introduction
We introduced and developed a large-scale traffic accident dataset named TAD (Traffic Accident Detection). We sourced this dataset from video surveillance, focusing specifically on highway scenarios. By addressing the limitations of existing datasets—such as their small scale and limited scope—we aimed to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of traffic accident detection systems.

We recognized that current traffic accident datasets are often not derived from surveillance cameras, not publicly available, or not tailored for highway situations. To meet the urgent need for an open-sourced dataset that encompasses various scenes from surveillance cameras, we created the TAD dataset. This addresses a significant gap in the field and provides practical importance.

We conducted a range of experiments on image classification, video classification, and object detection tasks using public mainstream vision algorithms or frameworks. We did this to evaluate and demonstrate the performance of different methods, allowing us to assess and compare the effectiveness of various technologies in the context of traffic accident detection.

We presented the proposed TAD dataset along with our experimental results as a new benchmark. We established this benchmark to advance research in computer vision, particularly in the application of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), by providing a standardized platform for evaluating and improving detection methods.

## TAD dataset
TAD contains serious traffic incidents caused by rain, vandalism or other factors, with a total of 344 videos covering 277 positive ones with traffic accidents and 127 negative ones without traffic accidents.

We made the TAD dataset publicly available on GitHub. We ensured that researchers worldwide can access and utilize this valuable resource for further research and development, fostering collaboration and innovation in the field.
